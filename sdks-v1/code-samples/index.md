# Code Samples

On this page, you'll find code samples and small apps that demonstrate Optimizely X Full Stack features. These resources were provided both by Optimizely staff and members of our developer community.

Our demo applications will help you become more familiar with our SDKs and can be run in your own environment. We have also provided some SDK wrappers built by external developers, which can be used to further extend functionality.
