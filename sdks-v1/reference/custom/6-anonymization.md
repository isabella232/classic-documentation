In some countries, you may be required to remove the last block of an IP address to protect the identity of your visitors. Optimizely allows you to easily remove the last block of your visitors' IP address before we store results data. This feature is currently available only for iOS, tvOS, and Android projects. To enable IP anonymization, see our [Optiverse article](https://help.optimizely.com/Set_Up_Optimizely/Privacy_settings%3A_IP_anonymization_in_SDK_projects).
