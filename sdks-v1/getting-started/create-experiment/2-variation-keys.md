Each version of an experience within your webpage or app is called a variation, and each _variation key_ is the identifier for the code that powers each experience. In this example, we demonstrate how to create [an A/B test](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/ab-testing/), so there will be two variations: the original version and the new version. We're calling the original version `control` and the new version `treatment`.
