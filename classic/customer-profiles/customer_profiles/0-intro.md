Customer Profiles are a collection of your customers' attributes across several Tables. The following APIs allow you to create, update, and read customer attributes for a single Table.

To use these APIs, we recommend that you first read the sections on
[DCP Services](/rest/reference#dcp_services), [Tables](/rest/reference#dcp_tables),
and [attributes](/rest/reference#dcp_attributes)

Using the [consolidated customer profile](/rest/reference/#consolidated-profile) API call, you can retrieve
the complete Customer Profile across all Tables.
