Customer Profiles are a collection of your customers' attributes across several Tables. The following APIs allow
you to create, update, and read customer attributes for a single Table.

To use these APIs, we recommend that you first read the sections on
[DCP Services](#dcp_services), [Tables](#dcp_tables),
and [Attributes](#dcp_attributes)

Using the [consolidated customer profile](#consolidated-profile) API call, you can retrieve
the complete Customer Profile across all Tables.
