<b>Uploaded Lists have been replaced by List Attributes.</b> Please use the <a href="/x/rest/v2/#list_attributes">updated endpoints</a> to create and manage lists. See our <a href="https://help.optimizely.com/Target_Your_Visitors/Set_up_list_attributes">knowledge base</a> for information on how to use lists in the Optimizely UI.

An uploaded list is a set of user identifiers that you have uploaded to Optimizely. Membership in a targeting list can be used to define an Optimizely audience, so you can target experiments only to a particular set of users.

We currently support three targeting list formats: cookies, query parameters and zip codes.

Uploaded lists are an Enterprise feature and may not be available for your Optimizely account. If you are uncertain whether you have access or would like to request access for development purposes, [submit a ticket to the developer support team](https://optimizely.com/support).
